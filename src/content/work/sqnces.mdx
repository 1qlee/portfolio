In sqnces, you deduce a hidden word using a required three-letter sequence (substring). Every guess submitted must contain this specific sequence. Positional clues are given after each attempt, indicating how your letters match the hidden word's letters and positions.
<br />
There is a new puzzle every day with 3 different game modes: a 6, 7, and 8 letter word to solve.
